Here I am unable to push the other node-module files . So I kept that src files .

The React to-do list application consists of several components, each with a specific role. The App.jsx component manages the core logic of the application, including state for the to-do list, editing status, and the current task being modified. It uses useEffect to load and save tasks to localStorage, ensuring the data persists across refreshes. Functions like addTodo, toggleComplete, deleteTodo, and editTodo handle task management. The app.css file styles the application, resetting default browser settings, applying background images, and ensuring a clean, modern layout with consistent typography and responsive design. The TodoForm.jsx component handles the form input, allowing users to add or edit tasks. It manages the input field's state and adjusts its behavior based on whether a task is being edited. The Todo.jsx component represents individual tasks, displaying them with options to complete, edit, or delete, while conditionally styling completed tasks. Finally, the TodoList.jsx component renders the full list of tasks by mapping over the array of to-dos and passing the necessary props for task management. Together, these files create a well-structured, easy-to-maintain application, with a clear separation of logic, styling, and task rendering.
